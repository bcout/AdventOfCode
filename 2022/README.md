# 2022

I am using this year to learn how to program in Rust.

## Day 1: Calories

Learning how to read files and use vectors as stacks.

## Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors

Challenge: I'm not allowing myself to use if statements for the game logic (for part 2).

The whole thing must be done through hashmap lookups.

## Day 3: Rucksacks

Challenge: I have to implement Waldo Search (see the comment at the top of `/rucksacks/src/main.rs`)

Tried to use intersections and such, but gave up and just used a triple nested for loop instead (realized later I could have just used `.contains()` on a hashset)
 
## Day 4: Sections

Learned how to use RegEx in Rust.

## Day 5: Crane

Combined RegEx with stacks.

## Day 6: Start of Packet

Read subsets of characters in a string, instead of just going letter-by-letter from beginning to end. For instance, you'd read characters 0-3, then 1-4, then 2-5, etc.

## Day 8: Tree House

Learned how to use 2D vectors to treat data like a matrix.
